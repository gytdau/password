A simple site that generates password formulas for you.

## What is a password formula?
A password formula is a set of instructions to generate a unique password for every site. They're a useful alternative to password managers - you don't need to install anything, just follow the formula you generated earlier to get your password. A good password formula also has instructions that make a password unique to every site (e.g. add the first letter of the site's name) to greatly increase password security.
